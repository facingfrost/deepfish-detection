# Environment and reproducibility

All the experiments here were executed under Python 3.11.2 and using the package versions specified in `requirements.txt` and `seed == 0`.
It is strongly advised to create a new virtual enviroment to execute this code (i.e. `python3 -m virtualenv venv'`).

# Folder and file structure

Basically the project follows a folder hierarchy that is compatbile with the one used by YOLO:
```
.
├── datasets
│   ├── fish4knowledge
│   ├── images
│   ├── images_preprocessed
│   ├── labels
│   └── videos
├── data.yaml
├── deep_fish.ipynb
├── output_video
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── runs
```

- `dataset` is an important folder containing both the base images, the `images_preprocessed` that are generated by the preprocessing script (located inside the jupyter notebook), the `labels` of every image and the generated `videos` as well. For the sake of making the model easier to reproduce, we are also sharing the same `fish4knowledge` dataset that was used to measure the generalization of our methods.
- `data.yaml` is a configuration file used by YOLO to specify the paths of the images;
- `deep_fish.ipynb` is the jupyter notebook containing all the code used.
- `output_video` contains a sample of the model being applied in a test video;
- `requirements.txt` contains the exact package versions used to run these experiments;
- `runs` contains the result of each model, including the `weights`, performance metrics, execution sample and more information. The weights can be used directly, without needing to train the models again.

%% # Dataset
%% The dataset I uploaded is already resized and can be upload to github for immediate training.
%% For the original data for better training, you can download it here:

%% [Deepfish.](https://alzayats.github.io/DeepFish/)

%% [Bounding box in json format.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16SDv_V7RDjTKDk8uodL2ubyubYTMdd5q) FISH.tar.gz is deepfish.

%% [Bouding box in COCO format.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/deep-fish-object-detection)

%% [The source of this github data.](https://universe.roboflow.com/brrrrrrr/deepfish-fmyzf) Select yolo8 format to download.

%% Note that if you want to download the images from source link, you'll need to re-organize the folders following [ultralytics documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/#ultralytics-yolo-format). If the images doesn't match the required format, yolo model may not be able to recognize train and test images.

%% # Model training and testing

%% - `preprocessing_img.py` contains a script to generate the data augmented images;
%% - `scripts.ipynb` contains the first version of the model;
%% - `deep_fish_v2.ipynb` contains the current version of the model being used, as well as the video generation functionality;
